A simple Python Program that takes inputs of angles and lengths and draws cool shapes!

The Program will display a turtle screen when first run, but will require inputs via the terminal before making shapes.

NOTE: This program may not operate as expected if run in VS code. To ensure proper functionality, please run the script from the command line!
