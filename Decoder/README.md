A simple encoding and decoding program

The program will prompt for the value 1 or 2 based on what function the user wants to do:
    1 - code a message
    2 - decode a encrypted message

Once the user selects a function, they will be promted for a numerical key. 
    To encode a message - This is used to offset the encryption by a certain value.
    To decode and encrypted message - This value is used to reset the offsetted message.

THE KEY WILL BE NEEDED TO DECRPYT AN ENCODED MESSAGE!

After the key is inputed, they will be prompted for a message. 
    To encode a message - Enter the phrase or message you want to encrypt.
    To decode and encrypted message - Enter the encrypted message received from the encryption function.
