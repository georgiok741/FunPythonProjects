A fun Python MadLib simulator!

Instructions:
1. Enter Madlib Input:
    The first input with ask you for a mad lib. Feel free to enter any sentence you want, but any words/phrases you would like the player to fill in must be denoted with a "(^type_of_phrase/word^)".

    For example, if you would like the player to fill in their name, you can enter "Hi (^proper-noun^)". This will later promt the player to fill in the madlib.

    A fun sample madlib to input is provided here:
    
    Hey diddle diddle, the (^noun^) and the fiddle, The (^noun^) (^past-tense verb^) over the moon, The (^adjective^) (^noun^) (^past-tense verb^) to see such fun, And the (^noun^) (^past-tense verb^) away with the spoon!

2. Enter Blank lines:
    The next input the program will request is for you to enter a number of blank lines to hide the madlib. This simply is asking you how many lines you would like skip down to avoid the other player seeing the full madlib.

    For example. If your inputed madlib is only one sentence long. You can choose to enter "20" as the number of lines you would like to skip. This will push the screen down 20 lines and enable you to pass the computer to the next player without them seeing what you inputed.


3. Enter Madlib words/phrases:
    Finally, the program is intended to be passed to another player to enter the inputs for the madlib.

    You have an option of entering multiple values for each input which will cause the program to pick one for you, creating a element of randomness to add to the fun! Just remember to seperate the multiple options you provide with commas.
